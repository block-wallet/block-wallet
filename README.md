# BlockWallet

BlockWallet is the most private, non-custodial Ethereum browser wallet.

BlockWallet uses smart contracts that allow users to hide the amounts and origins of cryptocurrency held, in a decentralized and frictionless manner.

Each time you want to make a withdrawal, BlockWallet will create a new wallet address for you with the amount of crypto that you requested, which originates from the smart contract where everyone’s funds are pooled.
